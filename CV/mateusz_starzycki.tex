\cventry{2012 - 2013}{Samsung Electronics}{\newline (13 months) Software engineer}{Warsaw, PL}{}{}
First stage of cooperation with Samsung company was strongly focused on training. During my first month of
work I was assigned to training task connected with Linux kernel development, the project introduce creation of
module tracing system calls usage from user space. I have also taken part in the porting and driver development
of Linux, arm assembler and arm architecture courses. Later I was reassigned for inner tool project - offline
analyzer of dump states, the project was written in C++ using QT libraries with parallel process communication.
After final stage I was responsible for designing tool for retrieving ramdumps from phones using the USB
communication. Currently I am not only developing inner tools but I have also became responsible for new model
camera driver. This role introduced new responsibilities - usage of p4v version manager software, usage and
understanding of Linux build system and capability to fast bug tracing based on logs and offline debugging.
